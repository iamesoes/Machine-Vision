# Machine Vision Exercises on Matlab

I took machine vision course so these are the exercises from that course.



## Content

- **Exercise 1 ->** read image, show image, adjust contrast, histogram equalization to enhance contrast, plot histogram, writing a function displaying both the original image and an enhanced image
- **Exercise 2 ->** Show the three different channels of the color image (RGB), changing color space to hsv (hue, saturation, value) and yiq (luminance, hue, saturation), converts rgb color image to grayscale image
- **Exercise 3 ->** seperate different regions with different colors, enumerates regions in the image, remove regions that touch the borders, calculate the area, apply threshold to an image, compare with im2bw function
- **Exercise 4 ->** fix broken text with dilation operation; examples of erotion, dilation, opening 
- **Exercise 5 ->** fixing noisy(salt and pepper) image with median filter, using unsharp filter via fspecial
- **Exercise 6 ->** distance transforms and watershed transform
